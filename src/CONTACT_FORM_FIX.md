### Option 2: Check Manually in Supabase
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fseoedndjvvjikwcryck/editor
2. Look for the `contact_submissions` table in the left sidebar
3. If you see it, the setup is complete!

## 📊 What the Table Does

The `contact_submissions` table stores:
- **id** - Unique identifier for each submission
- **name** - Visitor's name
- **email** - Visitor's email address
- **phone** - Optional phone number
- **subject** - Message subject
- **message** - The actual message content
- **created_at** - When the form was submitted
- **status** - Submission status (default: "new")
