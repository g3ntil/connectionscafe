# ⚡ QUICK FIX SUMMARY - Vercel Routing

## What Was Done

Three critical fixes for 404 errors on direct navigation:

1. **Updated `/vercel.json`**
   - Changed `"destination": "/"` → `"destination": "/index.html"`
   - Added cache control headers

2. **Improved `/public/404.html`**
   - Added path preservation logic
   - Better redirect handling

3. **Removed bad files**
   - Deleted `/public/_redirects/` directory
   - Removed incorrect TSX files

## Deploy Right Now

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Vercel routing with explicit /index.html"
git push origin main

# Wait 2-3 minutes for build

# Then in Vercel Dashboard:
# Settings → General → Clear Cache (CRITICAL!)

# Then redeploy:
git commit --allow-empty -m "Redeploy after cache clear"
git push origin main
```

## Test After Deploy

Open in **incognito mode**:

- `https://connectionscafe.vercel.app/menu`
- `https://connectionscafe.vercel.app/about`
- `https://connectionscafe.vercel.app/contact`
- `https://connectionscafe.vercel.app/secure-portal-musanze-2025`

**Expected:** All load without 404 ✅

## Why This Works

**Before:**
```json
{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
```
❌ Ambiguous - sometimes works, sometimes doesn't

**After:**
```json
{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
```
✅ Explicit - always serves the React app

---

## If It Still Fails

1. Clear Vercel cache (most common issue)
2. Test in incognito mode (browser cache)
3. Check build logs for errors
4. Verify `vercel.json` is in root directory
