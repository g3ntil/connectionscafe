CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contact_submissions (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'new',
  notes TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contact_submissions_created_at 
  ON contact_submissions(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contact_submissions_status 
  ON contact_submissions(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contact_submissions_email 
  ON contact_submissions(email);

ALTER TABLE contact_submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can manage all contact submissions" 
  ON contact_submissions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can submit contact form" 
  ON contact_submissions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can read contact submissions" 
  ON contact_submissions;

CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all contact submissions"
  ON contact_submissions FOR ALL TO service_role 
  USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can submit contact form"
  ON contact_submissions FOR INSERT TO anon, authenticated 
  WITH CHECK (true);
