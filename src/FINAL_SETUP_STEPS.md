## ⚠️ ONE THING LEFT TO DO

**Create the contact form database table** (takes 2 minutes)

### Why This Is Needed
The contact form needs a database table to store submissions. This is a one-time setup that couldn't be automated due to Supabase security restrictions.

---

## 🚀 How to Complete Setup

### Method 1: Automated Helper (Recommended)
1. Navigate to **`/db-check`** in your browser
2. The page will check if the table exists
3. Click **"Copy SQL"** button
4. Click **"Open SQL Editor"** button
5. Paste and click **"Run"**
6. Done! ✅

### Method 2: Manual Copy-Paste
1. Open **`/CREATE_TABLE.sql`** file in this project
2. Copy the entire SQL script
3. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fseoedndjvvjikwcryck/sql
4. Paste and click **"Run"**
5. Done! ✅

### Method 3: Ultra-Quick
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fseoedndjvvjikwcryck/sql
2. Copy this SQL and run it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contact_submissions (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'new',
  notes TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_contact_submissions_created_at ON contact_submissions(created_at DESC);
ALTER TABLE contact_submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all contact submissions"
ON contact_submissions FOR ALL TO service_role USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can submit contact form"
ON contact_submissions FOR INSERT TO anon, authenticated WITH CHECK (true);
```
