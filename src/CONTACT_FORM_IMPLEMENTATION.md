## Database Table Schema

```sql
contact_submissions
├── id (UUID, Primary Key, Auto-generated)
├── name (TEXT, Required)
├── email (TEXT, Required)

```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_contact_submissions_created_at` - For sorting by date

- Service role can manage all records
- Authenticated users can read all records

## How to Set Up

### Step 1: Create the Database Table

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fseoedndjvvjikwcryck/sql

2. Copy and paste the SQL from `DATABASE_SETUP.md`

3. Click "Run" to create the table

### Step 2: Test the Form

1. Visit your Contact page: https://yoursite.com/contact

2. Fill out the form:

3. Click "Send Message"

4. Watch for the green success message

5. Verify in Supabase:
   - Go to Table Editor
   - Select `contact_submissions`
   - See your test submission

### Step 3: Check Submissions

**Via Supabase Dashboard:**
- Table Editor → `contact_submissions`
- View, edit, delete submissions
- Update status as you process them

**Via API (for admin panel):**
```bash
GET https://fseoedndjvvjikwcryck.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-786b768a/contact/submissions
```

## API Endpoints

Update status directly in the Supabase Table Editor.
