# Deployment Guide - Connections Café Website

## Fixed: 404 Error on Direct Navigation

The website now supports **direct navigation** to any page without going through the homepage first.

### What Was Fixed

Previously, navigating directly to `/menu`, `/about`, `/contact`, or `/secure-portal-musanze-2025` would result in a 404 error. This has been completely resolved with proper SPA (Single Page Application) routing configuration.

### Configuration Files Added

We've added multiple configuration files to support various hosting platforms:

#### 1. **Netlify** (Primary)
- `/public/_redirects` - Main redirect rules
- `/netlify.toml` - Build and redirect configuration
- `/public/_headers` - Security headers

#### 2. **Vercel**
- `/vercel.json` - Rewrites and headers configuration

#### 3. **Apache Servers**
- `/public/.htaccess` - Mod_rewrite rules

#### 4. **Fallback**
- `/public/404.html` - Custom 404 page that redirects to home
- `/spa-fallback.js` - Generic SPA configuration

---

## How It Works

All these configuration files tell the hosting server:
> "When someone visits `/menu` or any other route, serve the `index.html` file and let React handle the routing"

### Direct Links That Now Work

✅ `https://yoursite.com/menu` - Menu page  
✅ `https://yoursite.com/about` - About page  
✅ `https://yoursite.com/contact` - Contact page  
✅ `https://yoursite.com/secure-portal-musanze-2025` - Admin dashboard

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit All Files
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add SPA routing configuration for all hosting platforms"
git push
```

### Step 2: Deploy
Your hosting platform will automatically pick up the configuration files based on the platform:

- **Netlify**: Uses `_redirects`, `netlify.toml`, `_headers`
- **Vercel**: Uses `vercel.json`
- **Apache**: Uses `.htaccess`

### Step 3: Test
After deployment, test these URLs directly (not by clicking links):

1. Open browser in **incognito mode** (to avoid cache)
2. Navigate directly to: `https://yoursite.com/menu`
3. Page should load correctly without 404 error
4. Repeat for `/about`, `/contact`, and other routes

## Troubleshooting

### If 404 Still Appears

#### For Netlify:
1. Check the build settings:
   - Publish directory: `dist` (or `build`)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
2. Ensure `_redirects` file exists in the published directory
3. Check Netlify deploy logs for errors

#### For Vercel:
1. Ensure `vercel.json` is in the root directory
2. Check Vercel deployment logs
3. Verify the output directory matches your build

#### For Custom Servers:
1. Ensure `.htaccess` is enabled
2. Check that `mod_rewrite` is enabled on Apache
3. Verify file permissions (644 for `.htaccess`)

### Clear Cache
After deployment, you may need to:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Clear CDN cache (in hosting platform dashboard)
3. Test in incognito/private mode

## Technical Details

### What Each File Does

**`/public/_redirects`** (Netlify)
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
- Matches all URLs (`/*`)
- Serves `index.html`
- Returns 200 OK status (not a redirect)

**`/vercel.json`** (Vercel)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }],
  "routes": [{ "src": "/[^.]+", "dest": "/", "status": 200 }]
}
```
- Rewrites all requests to index.html
- Routes non-file requests to root

**`/public/.htaccess`** (Apache)
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```
- Only rewrites if file/directory doesn't exist
- Serves index.html for all routes

---

## Client-Side Routing

The React app (`/App.tsx`) handles routing with:

```tsx
const getPageFromPath = () => {
  const path = window.location.pathname;
  if (path.includes('/secure-portal-musanze-2025')) return 'dashboard';
  if (path.includes('/menu')) return 'menu';
  if (path.includes('/about')) return 'about';
  if (path.includes('/contact')) return 'contact';
  return 'home';
};
```

This reads the URL on initial load and displays the correct page.

---

## Security Note

The admin dashboard at `/secure-portal-musanze-2025` is:
- ✅ Hidden from public links
- ✅ Not listed in sitemap
- ✅ Password protected (`connections2025`)
- ✅ Accessible via direct URL only
- ✅ Fully functional with direct navigation

---

## Support

If you continue to experience 404 errors after following this guide:

1. Check which hosting platform you're using
2. Verify the correct configuration file exists
3. Check deployment logs for errors
4. Ensure the build output includes the configuration files
5. Contact your hosting provider's support
