# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST - Connections Café

## ✅ PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (All Green!)

### Critical Files
- ✅ `/vercel.json` - Has Vercel Community recommended rewrites config

- ✅ `/public/404.html` - Fallback handler with redirect
- ✅ `/App.tsx` - React Router with BrowserRouter
- ✅ All page components exist (HomePage, MenuPage, AboutPage, ContactPage)

### Configuration Verified
- ✅ Using `rewrites` (not `routes`)
- ✅ Source: `"/(.*)"` matches all routes
- ✅ Destination: `"/index.html"` serves React app

Open in new browser tab/window:

□ https://connectionscafe.vercel.app/

```

### Test 3: Incognito Test
```

3. Check if MenuPage loads

Expected: ✅ MenuPage loads directly
```

### Test 4: Browser Navigation
```
1. Home → Menu → About → Contact (using header links)
2. Press back button 3 times
3. Press forward button 3 times

Expected: ✅ History works correctly
```

### Test 5: Share Link Test
